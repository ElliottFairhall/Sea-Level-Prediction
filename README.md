## Description

The Sea Level Prediction project aims to predict the sea level rise for the next 50 years using various models and data sources. The project will involve analysing historical sea level data, identifying trends and patterns, and developing models to predict future sea level changes.

## Requirements

To complete the Sea Level Prediction project, you will need the following:

### Data Sources

-   Historical sea level data from reliable sources such as NOAA or NASA
-   Climate data such as temperature and precipitation records
-   Satellite data on sea level and ice sheet melting
-   Other relevant data sources such as ocean currents and wind patterns

### Tools and Software

-   Data analysis tools such as Python, R, or MATLAB
-   Statistical modelling software such as SAS or SPSS
-   Data visualization tools such as Tableau or Matplotlib

### Skills and Knowledge

-   Strong understanding of statistics and data analysis techniques
-   Familiarity with  Python and visualisations
-   Experience working with large datasets and data cleaning
-   Knowledge of climate science and oceanography

## Deliverables

The following are the expected deliverables for the Sea Level Prediction project:

-   A report detailing the analysis of historical sea level data, including any trends or patterns identified
-   A set of statistical models predicting future sea level rise based on the analysis of historical data and other relevant data sources
-   Data visualizations to help communicate the results of the analysis and predictions to stakeholders
-   A presentation to stakeholders summarizing the findings of the analysis and predictions, and highlighting any potential implications for coastal communities or infrastructure.
